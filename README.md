·        The application must have user authentication ( Sign In/ Sign Up )

·        After logging in users will be navigated to the home screen where they should see a search option where they can search movies and see details of those movies.

·        They can create a list of movies by adding the movies to lists. (Similar to YouTube playlists). On the home page, different movie lists created by that user will be displayed.

·        These lists can be either public ( anyone with a link to the list can see this ) or private ( only the person who created can see this list )

·        You can use OMDB API for the movie search option.
